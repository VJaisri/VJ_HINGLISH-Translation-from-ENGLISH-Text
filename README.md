# Crisp of the Model
* The script begins by tokenizing the English text and utilising the nltk library to identify nouns.
* The input text is then translated using the Helsinki-NLP translation model after these nouns have been translated.
* After that, using a combination of consonant and vowel mappings, the Hindi text is further translated into a more intelligible Hinglish version.
* To replace the translated nouns with their original English equivalents, the script performs a noun-switching phase.
